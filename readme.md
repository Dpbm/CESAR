# Cesar Cipher

## this is an old project that I've made using python, and recently I remembered and decided to see and refactor all the project

<br />


## üìÅFolders

Into the [oldVersion](/oldVersion/) folder you can see how the project were when I started to program

And in the [newVersion](/newVersion/) folder you will see the project now that I have more experience and knowledge

<br />



## üì∑ How it looks

### Old Version

## Dependencies

- tk (see how to install [windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-in-windows/), [linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-on-linux/) & [mac](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-on-macos/))
- python3


<br />


## How it works?

When I've made this project, my idea was create a different version of Cesar's Cipher, so I've implemented a random dislocation for the characters and added a repetition. So when you enter with the repetitions and the text, the script will repeat `N times` the process of generate a random dislocation and get the corresponding character. At the end of execution, the script will generate an `encrypted.txt` file, that contains the key to decrypt the text and the encrypted text.

## üèÉHow to run


Old Version
```bash
    python3 /oldVersion/mainRefactor.py
```

New Version
```bash
    python3 /newVersion/CESAR.py
```

`note:  the file /oldVersion/CESAR.py doesn't work as expected, it's only for test`
